1grncz6,I don't like the future of DE,"Sup folks! Of course, opinions are always biased, but I feel like DE is moving towards SaaS encapsulating low-level work (specially ETLs) for 80% of companies (yes I made that up), but think about it: standardized formats are the norm now, so it's pretty easy to create a ""simple"" ETL, according to the dummies at C-level; so, imho ETL work will be delegated to analysts, or DEs will absorb the analyst work (won't happen honestly). What do you guys think?

As a side note: Currently I'm tired of python + AWS + SQL, it's always ""create a py script, use Glue and move to Snowflake"". I don't want to be siloed into these shitty GUIs, what should I study to become a platform/SWE data-oriented engineer? I was thinking about Rust but what else? I just have 2 YOE so open to hear your thoughts + advice.

1grff61,Is this normal when beginning a career in DE?,"For context I’m an 8 year military veteran, was struggling to find a job outside of the military, and was able to get accepted into a veterans fellowship that focused on re-training vets into DA. Really the training was just the google course on DA. My BS is in the Management of Information Systems, so I already knew some SQL. 

Anyways after 2 months, thankfully the company I was a fellow at offered me a position as a full time DE, with the expectation that I continue learning and improving.. 

But here’s the rub. I feel so clueless and confused on a daily basis that it makes my head spin lol. I was given a loose outline of courses to take in udemy, and some practical things I should try week by week. But that’s about it. I don’t really have anyone else I work with to actively teach/mentor me, so my feedback loop is almost non existent. I get like one 15 minute call a day, with another engineer when they are free to ask questions and that’s about it. 

Presently I’m trying to put together a DAG, and realizing that my Python skills are super basic. So understand and wrapping my head around this complex DAG without a better feedback loop is terrifying and I feel kinda on my own. 

Is this normal to be kinda left to your own devices so early on? Even during the fellowship period I was kind of loosely given a few courses to do, and that was it? I’m obviously looking and finding my own answers as I go, but I can’t help but feel like I’m falling behind as I have to stop and lookup everything piecemeal. Or am I simply too dense?

1grnifi,How much does company name brand have a positive/negative effect on career prospects?,"Curious to hear people's experiences on the job hunt. I've got a couple different offer options, 2 from more name brand (but not FAANG companies) and one from insurance side (actually more a negative brand). The offers are summed up like: 

1. Name brand 1 tech stack: palantir (python/spark) more startup feel

2. Name brand 2 tech stack: snowflake/snowpark heavy, but not core DE role & career change into junior SA

3. Insurance brand 3 tech stack: AWS/spark/python. Older more ""dinosaur"" brand. 

  
This is just for illustration, as obviously each of these has it's plus pros and cons. I do feel like the tech stack is best in the last one, to be applicable to most roles afterwards. 

However, what I'm more interested in is, what impact does name brand have? Is it better to join a ""name brand"" company, even if other parts of the role seem worse comparatively? Or is it better to join a lower tier company where it sounds like the job is more inline with interests? What has been your experience?

1grg4kt,Z-Order and Liquid Clustering in Databricks,"This year, Liquid Clustering in Databricks became generally available. I’ve read that it speeds up queries by 2 to 12 times, with files being optimized incrementally. It sounds really nice,  but because I have worked with data since the early version of SQL Server I was curious about what is happening under the hood.

I found that Z-ordering uses a Z-order curve to organize data. The use of this curve helps improve query performance through data skipping. This means that some files can be skipped when we query data using a filter value, reducing the need to read them. Liquid Clustering uses a Hilbert curve, where points on the curve always have a distance of one but the Z-Order does not have this feature. This means for Z-Order, potentially some files will have a min/max range equal to the full range, and data skipping can’t skip these files.

Additionally, Z-Order requires rewriting all files, whereas Liquid Clustering does this incrementally.

1gs08s2,Embedded BI is overrated for customer-facing analytics,"Hot take: embedded BI tools like Looker and Tableau are not the right choice for customer-facing analytics in most cases. I know this is a controversial opinion, but hear me out.

I'm the founder of an analytics startup (quill.co) and I've seen the pros and cons of different approaches firsthand. For internal data science and analytics, BI tools are great. I see teams using Power BI, Tableau, Sigma, Hex, Jupyter, Streamlit, Metabase and more.

But for exposing data and insights to your customers, you really want a tailored, seamless experience that matches your product's UI and UX. The most serious companies know this and invest in building customer-facing analytics in-house. It gives them complete flexibility and control.

The exception is for highly technical products and users. For example, observability tools often embed Grafana since their users prefer its raw functionality. But in most other domains, embedded BI ends up being an awkward compromise when you can't fully build the analytics experience you want yourself.

I'm obviously biased, but this is why I started Quill - to give companies the fast time-to-value of embedded BI combined with the customization and extensibility of building it themselves. We use a developer-oriented approach to empower data teams.

What has your experience been with customer-facing analytics? Have embedded BI tools worked well for you or do you prefer building in-house? Let me know your thoughts!

1gry5k4,Feedback Needed: Solution for parsing 100k XML Files in GCS to BigQuery Using PySpark,"Hi everyone,

I’m working on a data pipeline that processes between 60k-100k XML files (\~100 GB) stored in a bucket in GCS. These files are partitioned into batches of 20k, with an average file size of 300 KB (largest being 10 MB). The goal is to transform the XML data into JSON and load it into BigQuery.

Here’s the approach I’ve implemented using PySpark on Dataproc:

* **Create a DataFrame:** I load the XML data into a PySpark DataFrame directly from GCS  

`xml_df =SPARK_SESSION.read.format(""com.databricks.spark.xml"").options(rowTag=row_tag).load(batch)`

* **Transform to JSON:** I use this transformation to convert the DataFrame into JSON.  

`json_df = xml_df.select(to_json(struct([col for col in df.columns])).alias(""json_data""))`

* **Add Metadata:** For each record, I add the file path and a timestamp.

`json_df = json_df.withColumn(""input_path"", input_file_name())`  
`json_df = json_df.withColumn(""ingestion_ts"", current_timestamp())`

* **Write to BigQuery:** I load the resulting DataFrame into BigQuery.  

`df.write.format(""bigquery"").option(""writeMethod"",""direct"").mode(""append"").save(FULL_TABLE_ID)`

I want to ensure that this is an efficient and scalable solution. I’m looking for feedback on:

* Whether this is the right approach for such a use case.
* Suggestions for optimization, especially considering file sizes and batch processing, and spark config (# cores, executor/driver memory or any other important config I am missing).
* Recommended repositories, books, or resources to improve this pipeline.

The team primarily uses PySpark and Python, and we run pipelines on Google Dataproc. Any insights or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!",6,11,SirAlejo,2024-11-15 14:56:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1gry5k4/feedback_needed_solution_for_parsing_100k_xml/,0,False,True,False,False
1grhe73,Data Lakehouses for non-Data Engineers?,"Hi, I'm applying for an entry-level data engineer role and need to do a presentation about how the handling of data has evolved and I want to touch on data lakehouses. I've been researching Data Warehouses and Data Lakes and feel like I have my head around them roughly, but Lakehouses are tripping me up a bit. Here's a basic idea of how I understand them:

  
**Data Warehouse**  
\- Predefined schemas, great for structured data but don't really work for semi-structured or unstructured data  
\- Ideal for business insights/reporting tools  
\- Because of their nature, it's easy to keep track of data and ideal for data governance

**Data Lakes**  
\- Let's just chuck EVERYTHING WE FIND in here!  
\- Ideal for unstructured data and semi-structured data  
\- Because it doesn't support transactions, data can become corrupted, high data quality can be hard to maintain  
\- The lack of a predefined scheme makes it difficult for business insights and reporting, so you end up building data warehouses on top for anything that needs it  
\- Good for machine learning due to all the unstructured data  
\- Because just so much is being thrown in and it's hard to keep track, not ideal for data governance

**Data Lakehouse**  
\- Essentially starts as a data lake, harvesting all raw data into it. The ""bronze"" layer, if going by medallion architecture.  
\- Data is cleaned and ""validated"" and dumped in the ""silver"" layer  
\- Data goes through final preparation to make it ready for data analysts and machine learning in the ""gold"" layer

**What I'm confused on**  
From what I've gathered the benefits are, it ""centralises"" all your data, because ML and BI can both use the ""gold"" layer. But I'm not seeing how the gold layer is different to a data warehouse, it sounds like things have been put in a schema during preparation... And if so, how is the structured data stored/accessed there?

There's also images like [this one](https://www.databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/data-lakehouse-new.png), by the same company who describes the ""bronze/silver/gold"" layers, but they condense them all into a single ""metadata"" layer in this image. Is the data actually duplicated between each layer, but some metadata tracks the data lineage? Or is all the data actually just stored in one place and each ""layer"" is just metadata making sense of everything in the data lake below?

  
I'm beginning to think I might be diving in a little too deep for a presentation for an entry-level role; it looks like there's still debate around how good a solution Datalakes even are... probably not a topic a beginner can bring any interesting discussion to other than ""well these are also a thing""!",6,6,JobeyobeyCodes,2024-11-14 22:39:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1grhe73/data_lakehouses_for_nondata_engineers/,0,False,False,False,False

1gs5keq,Reverse Engineering Source Systems,"Hey all,

I recently put together a handful of tutorials on LinkedIn demonstrating how to reverse engineer a source system.

The motivation for me to share was a project I was on where I was basically asked to integrate an entire SQL Server instance into a data warehouse project without any documentation - no data dictionary, no ERD diagram, nothing. 

It wasn't a massive system - all of maybe 30 tables, each with maybe up to 50 columns - record counts in tens of millions or less.

That being said, it's still a ton of work to figure out what you're working with in a situation like this, so I came up with a few approaches to quickly make sense of a new source system, and I've documented those approaches in these tutorials.

All you need to work through them is access to Snowflake, as they're based on sample data already available (and you can easily setup a free trial account on Snowflake).

The third post is, in my opinion, the most interesting and most useful - but certainly some value in the first two posts as well.

Appreciate any and all feedback! Also still trying to figure out when/where I should be posting on LinkedIn, Reddit, elsewhere - in case any content creators have strong opinions, would love to hear 'em.

1gs0zgv,AWS DMS question ,"We had AWS DMS running for over 2 years. No issues until yesterday. One of our teams changed a table name and AWS DMS failed. We had no issues adding new tables or adding/changing columns in a table. I'm on a phone so don't have the details of the error but it was something  about DDL, the fix performed by our devops was to rebuild the table with the old name. This is seems like not a right approach.
